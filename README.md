# invites-plugin
Minecraft 1.19 plugin made to make your players want to invite their friends on your server !

**Invites** allows players to say who invited them on the server. 
Admins can set rewards as Luckperms groups (so [Luckperms](https://github.com/LuckPerms/LuckPerms) is needed on your server) and players having invited enough people will be added to the group and get all its permissions !
